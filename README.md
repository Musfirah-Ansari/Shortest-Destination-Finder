# Shortest-Destination-Finder
## INTRODUCTION
Shortest Destination Finder is an ultimate solution to daily life problems. This approach is based
on Breadth First Search-BFS algorithm. It works on a similar principle as BFS does. Main motive
of using this idea is to save our precious time. Among all the available possible paths, SDF will
discover the most optimal route in the wink of an eye.

### SCOPE
Most of the time ambulance drivers can’t find the shortest possible path or sometimes they don’t
know which route will be the shortest at the moment. SDF fits best here. Moreover, all these
services i-e Uber, Careem, Bykea etc use the same approach for navigation.

#### CONCLUSION
Breadth Search Algorithm comes with some great advantages. One of the many applications of
the BFS algorithm is to calculate the optimal path. It is also used in networking to find
neighboring nodes and can be found in social networking sites, network broadcasting, and
garbage collection.
